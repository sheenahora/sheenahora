### Hello, everyone 👋


I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services with 8 years of experience building production-grade systems across the stack, from backend services and data workflows to frontend components and cloud platforms on AWS.

I work on designing, implementing, and operating scalable systems in high-availability environments. My experience spans system design, APIs, event-driven architectures, data pipelines, and user-facing components, with a strong focus on automation, operational excellence, and measurable business outcomes.
