### Hello, folks ðŸ‘‹


Hello I am Sheena Hora and I am a dedicated, enthusiastic machine learning researcher. I am a Graduate student at University of Windsor pursuing masterâ€™s in computer science. My major is Artificial Intelligence..  I have 4+ years of professional experience as an IT Analyst in Tata Consultancy Services. I was awarded a Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence (2020-21). The most valuable skill that I possess is the ability to learn quickly and implement in my work. Currently looking for a role that will enable me to continue polishing my skills whilst being able to apply them in practice effectively.
